         <PRE >
           Zemenawi Sweater Factory was initially established in 1970 in Asmara as per the Commercial Code of Ethiopia at that time.It operated 
          as a cottage sweater producer targeting the markets of Asmara, Mekelle and Addis Ababa.After the dawn of the Dergue regime, and subse
          -quent creation of favorable business environment in Tigray, it moved its production plant to Mekelle in 1989.
          Following its reallocation to Mekelle, and after fulfilling all relevant investment and commercial laws, it started to operate in swe
          -ater manufacturing. It then dominated majority of the school uniforms business in Mekelle and supplied to other parts of Tigray. It 
          also expanded to the rest of the country through Addis Ababa and was major market player in the  textile sector. The apparel and text
          -ile sector satisfies one of the most important basic human needs, clothing. It can be segmented in to different categories including
         top wear, sportswear, outdoor apparel, bottom wear, underwear, denim jeans, sweater, jacket and coats, loungewear and others.

           The selection of organizational structure of the envisaged project is made based on similar garment manufacturing industries in the country,
          the capacity of the plant, complexity and technology mix of the plant. Organizational structure principles such as specialization, coordination,
          and departmentalization are also considered for design of structure that best suits the envisaged project. There will be two services and two departments 
          comprising fourteen functional teams.
            The services are legal services, and internal audit; and the departments are production and business development-operation. Production department will 
           consist eight teams, while operation includes six. 
            This arrangement is made based on the nature of each process and number of human resource requirement. Each service, department and team will be headed by 
            qualified and experienced professional.
